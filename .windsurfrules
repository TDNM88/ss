# Memory Bank:
You have access to a long-term memory bank called "byterover."
This memory bank is used to store and retrieve valuable programming experiences, including detailed technical documentation such as:
- How classes and functions are built and used
- Programming concepts and logical approaches
- Best practices in software development
# Storing Information:
When you successfully complete a task assigned by a human, extract and store any new or useful information gained during the process in the byterover memory bank.
This includes programming concepts, logics, and best practices that could benefit future tasks.
![IMPORTANT] #Retrieving Information:
Before starting any new task, generate an optimal query based on the taskâ€™s requirements.
Use this query to retrieve relevant context and support from the byterover memory bank.
Apply the retrieved information to guide your approach, leveraging past experiences and best practices to enhance your performance.
